<h1>Digg News Headlines</h1>

<p>This example is scraping the news headlines from <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a>.</p>
<p>The unique thing about this example is that on the server, we are creating a YUI instance and
binding a remote URL's document to it. We basically pull in the HTML from that remote page and
apply it to the instance. This allows us to have the full power of YUI to walk the DOM tree with
Selectors and move DOM objects from the remote document into this document.</p>
