<h1>Full Page Layout</h1>
<p>This example shows that you can use the same layout for the entire site, but with two lines
of Javascript on the server, you can change the entire layout.</p>
<p>Look at the source under the hood, the content is not set to <code>display: none</code>, it's 
simply not rendered to the client.</p>
<p>This is the powerful template engine that most people have been begging for.</p>
