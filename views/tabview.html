<h1>YUI 3.x Tabview</h1>
<p>This example is the proof of concept for the next generation YUI 3 widgets.</p>
<p>In this example, the TabView is fully rendered on the server and "enhanced" to allow 
for server side tab selection if Javascript is disabled. If you have Javascript enabled, the
TabView will behave as you would expect.</p>
